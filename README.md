# monotone-regression
This repository contains the R scripts corresponding to the manuscripts "BayesFreqCI.pdf" and "SLSE.pdf", discussing the  construction of confidence intervals for monotone regression.
We ue the R package Rcpp for connecting to the C++ code, used in the actual computations. For instructions on how to use the R package Rcpp on Mac, Windows or Linux, see, e.g., https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/020_install.html.
