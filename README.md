R scripts for confidence intervals in monotone regression

This repository acccompanies the manuscript "Confidence intervals in monotone regression", with authors Piet Groeneboom and Geurt Jongbloed (SLSE.pdf).

Coverage percentages of the SLSE (Smoothed Least Squares Estimator) and the Nadaraya-Watson estimator can be computed by running bootstrap_intervals_percentages.R and a boxplot of 1000 values of the estimates of f_0(0.6) for both estimators are produced by boxplot_simulation.R (sample size 500).
